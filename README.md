# Shiny app: Global disease health expenditure
*Note: This app is not perfect. It's still a work in progress.*

###Description:### We provide time series estimates for 188 countries in the world from 2000-2015 to evaluate how much countries progress throughout time on their health expenditure across different program areas.

 + Project: Tracking global health expenditure on the big 3 communicable diseases, namely HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Turberculosis
 + Purpose: To visualize/understand/vet the model output.
 + Target: Intended for internal use of international health finance team at IHME
